# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# actor = Actor.new({ first_name: "Benedict", last_name: "Cumberbatch", known_for: "Sherlock" })
# actor.save

# actor = Actor.create({ first_name: "Colin", last_name: "Farrel", known_for: "In Bruges" })
# actor = Actor.create({ first_name: "Kermit", last_name: "the Frog", known_for: "Muppet Babies" })
